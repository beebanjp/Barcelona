            <p>
                The Amazon Rainforest, the oldest surviving rainforest, 
                represents over half the worlds remaining rainforests and 
                contains an immense amount of biodiversity, much of which 
                can not be found anywhere else! By living high above the canopy 
                in our unique eco cabin you can witness and experience its beauty 
                first hand.

                    <li>Running through the north of the rainforest is the Amazon river. Flowing a length of around 6,400km, it is the second longest river in the world.</li>
                    <li>Around 400-500 indigenous Amerindian tribes call the Amazon rainforest home. It’s believed that about fifty of these tribes have never had contact with the outside world!</li>
                    <li>This area of immense natural beauty is sometimes referred to as ‘the lungs of the Earth’. This is because the rich vegetation takes carbon dioxide out of the air, and releases oxygen back in. In fact, more than 20% of the world’s oxygen is produced by the Amazon. Talk about fresh air!</li>

                        <li><strong>Eating Ants!:</strong>The Lemon Ant is a species of tiny ants native to the Amazon. They are called “lemon ants” because of their vague tangy, lemony taste similar to lemon sherbet. Feel free to have a try: it won’t hurt you and is likely to become one of your most memorable experiences in the rainforest.</li>

                <p>Some glowing reviews from previous happy tree-dwellers.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>&quot;This eco cabin is perfect for a family adventure, it’s situated deep in the jungle and the only thing that beats the location is the interior of the cabin which is no where short of unreal, there’s a small stove for those chilly nights , a kitchen equipped with everything you need and the bedroom where you without a doubt have the best nights sleep you have ever experienced listening to the sounds of the rainforest.
